Software testing determines if software works as expected, need to test different cases of functions/loops/conditionals/etc. (don't need to test every integer, just 1 for each case), test in small pieces so parts of code can be diagnosed individually (don't have to go through all of them to solve issue), write code in well defined units (functions/classes) & test them in isolation (called unit testing), can also do informal testing as you go (ex. print statements), put tests/expected answers in functions, assert(bool) asserts that boolean is true/aborts program with error if not (use on test results), can use 3rd person unit testing framework, integration testing involves bringing units into program after unit testing/retesting to make sure they're integrated properly (use spot checks on integrated behavior for now)
Code coverage describes how much of source code is executed while testing, statement coverage is percentage of statements exercised by test routines, branch coverage is percentage of branches (for conditionals, etc., aim for 100%) executed, loop coverage checks that loop works properly when it executes 0/1/2 times (if it works for 2 it should work for iterations more than 2), also need to test different categories of input (ex. for square root function test positive number, 0 negative number)
Conditional logic errors involve incorrect conditional/loop condition, infinite loop is loop that never ends, off-by-one errors involve loops that execute one too few/many times, incorrect operator precedence involves operators executing in different order than programmer expects, floating point precision issues involve floating point not having enough precision to store number, integer division error involves integer division being done when floating point division is meant (default when 2 integers used), accidental null statements when syntax improper/code does nothing (ex. if(c=='y'); has semicolon that ends condition), not using compound statement when required can mess up conditions (ex. don't put brackets around if condition, means only first statement part of if), using assignment = instead of equality == can cause error
Can handle errors within functions/pass error back to caller to deal with/halt program (for fatal errors)/throw exception
Interactive programs are ones user interacts with after running, non-interactive applications are ones that don't require user interaction (can be tools that produce immediate result/terminate, services that run silently in background to perform ongoing function), use std::cout for user facing messages in interactive program, for diagnostic/error output in interactive/non-interactive programs use std::err
Input validation used to check that std::cin user input conforms to what user is expecting, can be inline (prevents user from typing invalid input at all) or post entry (after user types, can let user enter input into string/validate/convert string if needed, can also let user enter what they want/let std::cin extract/handle errors)
Invalid text input types include input extraction that succeeds/is meaningless to program (ex. when asked for number then operator then number for arithmetic operation, user enters random symbol instead of arithmetic operator, use default case), input extraction that succeeds/gets additional unexpected input (ex. user enters 5*7 at first input prompt, input buffer gets information to finish program but executes weirdly, use cin.ignore to ignore extraneous characters), input extraction that fails (ex. character entered as number, can't be extracted/cin fails silently/default case repeated, check if cin.fail occurred to prevent), input extraction that succeeds/user overflows numeric value (ex. number entered is too large, program stores largest int value in number/fails at rest of input, handle same way as failed extraction)
Precondition is condition that must be true before code executes, invariant is condition that must be true while code (like loop) is executing, postcondition is condition that must be true after code executes
Assertion is expression that should be true unless program has a bug, does nothing if true, displays error message/aborts if false (should never happen in working execution, not something program can recover from), disabled if macro NEBDUG is defined (can be set by default in release builds by some IDEs), static_assert checked at compile time instead of runtime (expression must be constant)
